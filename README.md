<h1 align="center"> Collection of LaTeX templates </h1>
Just a collection of LaTeX templates that I wrote and use for my daily work. All of them have been written considering STEM person but they can be used for other purposes as well.

### Things the template already provides:
1. Fancy headers and footers.
2. Include mathematical equations.
3. Include chemical equations.
4. Typeset tables and arrays.
5. Extended symbols.
6. International languages such as English, German, French, Spanish.
7. Code listings.
8. Include images.
9. Font embedding.
